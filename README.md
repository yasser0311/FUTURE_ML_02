# 🚨 Task 02 – Customer Churn Prediction System (Future Interns ML Project)

This project is part of the **Machine Learning Track** in the Future Interns Data Science & Analytics Internship. The objective is to develop a churn prediction system that identifies users at risk of discontinuing service, using Spotify user data.

## 📁 Project Deliverables

### 🎧 1. Jupyter Notebook
**File:** `Spotify_Churn_Prediction_Task2.ipynb`

Includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (e.g., listening frequency, subscription intent)
- Churn label generation based on low engagement
- Trained models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Evaluation:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve
- Visual Insights:
  - Feature importance chart
  - Churn distribution plot
  - Listening behavior vs churn

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Classification modeling using Scikit-learn and XGBoost
- Data wrangling and label encoding
- Binary target creation from behavioral signals
- Evaluation using confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and classification report
- Visual storytelling with Seaborn and Matplotlib

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

| Tool         | Purpose                        |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Python (pandas, numpy) | Data processing |
| Scikit-learn | Modeling & evaluation |
| XGBoost      | Advanced tree-based classifier |
| Seaborn / Matplotlib | Data visualization |

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Users with **low podcast engagement** and **no interest in premium plans** are far more likely to churn
- Subscription plan and listening frequency significantly influence churn behavior
- XGBoost outperformed baseline models in ROC-AUC and precision

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Upload `Spotify_data.xlsx` into your Google Colab or local Jupyter environment.
2. Open and run `Spotify_Churn_Prediction_Task2.ipynb` step-by-step.
3. View outputs: churn scores, feature importances, evaluation metrics, and visuals.
